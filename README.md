# card10 North Sense

Pulse the vibration motor when the card10 points north. Wear it on your wrist or on your ankle to (maybe?) develop a sense for where north is. You can rotate the device any way you want â€“ the direction that is measured is the direction of the large, printed rockets.

Lower buttons decrease/increase time between measurements & vibrations.

The compass drawing code was taken from the relative compass by "grm".
